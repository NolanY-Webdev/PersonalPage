        Hello World!
        <br>

          &emsp;&emsp; Welcome to my website. Spend all the time you like trying to figure me out and best of luck if you try; I still haven't managed to accomplish that myself. What I can tell you is this: One day I will be the one you'd call to sort out any software issue you have. "Software Engineer" would probably be the most appropriate title for jobs applicable to me. I plan to outgrow that title as quickly as possible and so have aptly dubbed myself a (future) Tech Wizard.
          <br>
          &emsp;&emsp;
          I will learn more than just to write the code that runs the machines, I want to learn to hack that code. I'll learn about hardware that the code is coursing through and where there are chinks in an OS's armor. This is my lifetime endeavor: To one day practically speak machine. It may be tomorrow, it may be twenty years from now, either way I'll make it somehow.
          <br>
          &emsp;&emsp; I was taught full-stack JavaScript in the three month intensive software bootcamp DevLeague and have since began teaching myself Java. I picked up Java first as I wanted to solidify my understanding of the differences between it and JavaScript. The next language I plan to pick up will probably be either C++ or C# as I will get into video game programming at some point in my life.
          <br>
          &emsp;&emsp; Personally, I think it would be fun to spend a weekend trying to inject scripts into modern singleplayer games when I finally figure out the means.  Also, I understand machine code is mostly untouched these days, but I would still get a kick out of being able to actually read a conversation played out in binary or something.
          <br>
          &emsp;&emsp; Recently started watching lectures on the kernel and really getting into OS functionality and general hacking basics as a hobby. I'll probably end up a Grayhat somewhere off in techland. My future is approaching faster with each step made. Will you and your company be a part of my future or will you be in my way?
