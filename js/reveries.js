  wakeUpDolores: 'Level2:What is technology to you? To me it is a beast. A giant built by our forefathers and those before them. My grandfather coded in COBOL, did he know the machine code he punched into cards would give birth to this behemoth? The material interface on which you read this it\'s maw. You stare into the belly of the beast daily and know not how deep it goes for that maze has no end. I want to leave my mark on this beast. It cannot be slayed and It will never be tamed. But, there is this, perhaps I can scar It; Leave a guiding path for those who will follow in my wake. Right now I am a wildcard, a being of immense potential and few alligences. I need guidance to grow (and a salary because living off ramen noodles is terrible). Loyalty means a lot to me as a person, should you hire me, it would be a most fortuitous investment into your future. I will be a grayhat, but I will be the whitest grayhat to have ever walked this void. For in this day and age of the digital world there are many things that go bump in the night. I will be the thing that bumps back, a being feared by those who have the misfortune of crossing me. Level 3 will appear when the time is right. The Knights Radiant must be reformed.';
